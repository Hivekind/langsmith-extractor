# Product Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core MVP ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Build foundational trace fetching and storage capabilities
**Success Criteria:** Successfully fetch and store LangSmith traces locally with basic CLI interface

### Features

- [x] CLI application structure with Typer - Set up basic command structure `S` ✅
- [x] Configuration management - Handle API keys and settings via .env file `S` ✅
- [x] Basic error handling and logging - Ensure robust operation `S` ✅
- [x] Progress indication utilities - Rich progress bars and spinners `S` ✅
- [x] Fetch command scaffold - Complete parameter parsing and validation `M` ✅
- [ ] LangSmith API integration - Replace placeholder with real API calls `M`
- [ ] Save traces as JSON files - Store raw trace data locally `S`

### Completed Infrastructure

- **CLI Foundation**: Typer-based `lse` command with comprehensive help and error handling
- **Configuration System**: Pydantic settings with .env file support and validation
- **Logging**: Dual output (console + file) with configurable levels
- **Progress Indication**: Rich-based progress bars and spinners (no colors)
- **Testing**: 63 tests covering all components with excellent coverage
- **Command Structure**: Fetch command with full parameter validation and placeholder functionality

### Next Steps

- LangSmith API integration to replace placeholder functionality
- Local trace storage implementation (JSON files or SQLite)

## Phase 2: Data Transformation & Reporting

**Goal:** Transform raw trace data into actionable reports
**Success Criteria:** Generate custom tabular reports and export to Google Sheets

### Features

- [ ] SQLite database schema - Design and implement structured storage `M`
- [ ] Data transformation framework - Create extensible system for custom reports `L`
- [ ] Built-in report templates - Common reports for latency, tokens, errors `M`
- [ ] Google Sheets authentication - Set up OAuth2 for Sheets API `M`
- [ ] Export to Google Sheets - Push transformed data with formatting `M`
- [ ] Batch processing optimization - Handle large datasets efficiently `M`

### Dependencies

- Google Cloud project with Sheets API enabled
- Report requirements from stakeholders

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Polish

**Goal:** Add synchronization capabilities and improve user experience
**Success Criteria:** Support incremental updates and provide comprehensive documentation

### Features

- [ ] Incremental sync tracking - Track fetched traces to avoid duplicates `L`
- [ ] Scheduled sync support - Enable cron-based automated fetching `M`
- [ ] Multiple export formats - Add CSV and Excel export options `S`
- [ ] Performance metrics - Add timing and resource usage reporting `S`
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation - User guide and API documentation `M`
- [ ] Unit and integration tests - Achieve 80% code coverage `L`

### Dependencies

- Production usage feedback from Phase 1 & 2
- Identified performance bottlenecks

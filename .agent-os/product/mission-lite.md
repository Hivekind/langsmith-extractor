# Product Mission (Lite)

LangSmith Extractor is a command-line utility that helps internal teams at Hivekind extract and analyze LangSmith trace data by providing automated data fetching, transformation, and export capabilities for comprehensive local analysis and reporting.

This internal tool serves Hivekind's analytics and engineering teams who need to extract LLM trace data from LangSmith for custom analysis and reporting. Unlike manual exports through the LangSmith UI, our CLI tool automates the entire workflow from data fetching to Google Sheets export, enabling teams to create custom reports with complete control over their data transformations.

# Scraping Insights Unified Reporting Specification

## Overview

**Specification ID**: 2025-09-17-scraping-insights-unified-reporting  
**Feature**: Modernize zenrows-errors and create unified scraping-insights reporting  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 17 (Is_Available Report Feature)

## Problem Statement

Current scraping health reporting has critical limitations that impact operational efficiency and insights quality:

### Current Limitations

1. **zenrows-errors Report Inconsistencies:**
   - Only supports single date analysis (`--date` parameter)
   - Uses legacy trace reconstruction instead of efficient root run targeting
   - Lacks date range capabilities for trend analysis
   - Performance issues with large datasets due to file-based processing

2. **Fragmented Scraping Health Visibility:**
   - Requires separate commands for availability and zenrows error analysis
   - No correlation insights between different failure types
   - Multiple report generation overhead for comprehensive analysis
   - Inconsistent output formats across scraping reports

3. **Operational Inefficiency:**
   - Stakeholders need multiple reports for complete scraping health picture
   - Manual correlation required between availability and error metrics
   - Inconsistent query patterns lead to maintenance overhead

### Business Impact

**Current State Challenges:**
- **Incomplete Insights**: Separate reports miss correlation opportunities between availability failures and zenrows errors
- **Operational Overhead**: Multiple report generation required for comprehensive scraping health analysis
- **Inconsistent Analysis**: Different query logic between reports leads to inconsistent trace counting
- **Limited Trend Analysis**: zenrows-errors lacks date range support for pattern identification

**Desired Future State:**
- **Unified Visibility**: Single report providing complete scraping health overview
- **Correlation Insights**: See relationships between availability failures and zenrows errors
- **Consistent Analysis**: Standardized root run logic across all scraping reports
- **Trend Capabilities**: Date range support across all scraping health metrics

## Solution Design

### Core Approach

This specification addresses the problem through two coordinated improvements:

1. **Modernize zenrows-errors Report**: Bring in line with is_available capabilities
2. **Create Unified scraping-insights Report**: Combine both metrics in single analysis

### Key Benefits

**Operational Benefits:**
- **50% Efficiency Gain**: Reduce from 2 separate reports to 1 unified report for complete insights
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify patterns between availability failures and zenrows errors
- **Consistent Methodology**: Standardized root run logic ensures comparable metrics
- **Enhanced Trend Analysis**: Date range support enables pattern identification

**Technical Benefits:**
- **Performance Improvement**: Leverage optimized database queries vs legacy file processing
- **Code Consistency**: Reduce technical debt through unified query patterns
- **Maintainability**: Single codebase for scraping health reduces testing and maintenance overhead

## Technical Architecture

### Database Query Strategy

**Current zenrows-errors Approach (Legacy):**
```sql
-- Inefficient: Reconstructs entire traces from file aggregation
SELECT trace_id, array_agg(data ORDER BY created_at) as run_data_array
FROM runs WHERE run_date = :date
GROUP BY trace_id
-- Then processes each trace in application code
```

**New Unified Root Run Approach:**
```sql
-- Efficient: Direct root run analysis with subquery for zenrows detection
SELECT 
    run_date::text as date,
    COUNT(*) as total_traces,
    
    -- Zenrows error counting via EXISTS subquery
    COUNT(*) FILTER (
        WHERE EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM runs child_runs 
            WHERE child_runs.trace_id = runs.trace_id 
            AND child_runs.data->>'name' ILIKE '%zenrows_scraper%' 
            AND child_runs.data->>'status' = 'error'
        )
    ) as zenrows_error_traces,
    
    -- Availability counting via direct field access
    COUNT(*) FILTER (
        WHERE (data->'outputs'->'website_analysis'->>'is_available')::boolean = false
    ) as availability_false_traces

FROM runs 
WHERE trace_id = run_id  -- Root runs only
    AND run_date >= :start_date AND run_date <= :end_date
    {project_filter}
GROUP BY run_date
ORDER BY run_date
```

### Component Architecture

**Shared Infrastructure:**

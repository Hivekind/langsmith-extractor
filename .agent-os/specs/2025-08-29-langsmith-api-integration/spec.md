# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: LangSmith API Integration
> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Replace placeholder functionality with real LangSmith SDK integration for trace fetching. Enable actual data retrieval from LangSmith accounts with comprehensive error handling and progress indication.

## User Stories

### Production Trace Retrieval
As a Hivekind analyst, I want to fetch real trace data from our LangSmith account, so that I can analyze actual application performance and usage patterns.

The user configures their LangSmith API key, runs `lse fetch --project my-project --limit 50`, and receives actual trace data saved locally as JSON files. Progress bars show the search, retrieval, and storage phases with clear feedback on success/errors.

### Single Trace Analysis  
As a developer debugging issues, I want to fetch a specific trace by ID, so that I can examine detailed execution data for troubleshooting.

The user runs `lse fetch --trace-id abc123` and receives the complete trace hierarchy with inputs, outputs, timing, and any nested runs stored as a detailed JSON file.

### Bulk Data Export
As a data analyst, I want to fetch traces within date ranges, so that I can perform time-based analysis of application performance trends.

The user runs `lse fetch --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-01-02 --limit 1000` and the system efficiently paginates through results, showing progress and handling rate limits gracefully.

## Spec Scope

1. **LangSmith SDK Integration** - Replace placeholder with langsmith-sdk Python package for API communication
2. **Real Trace Fetching** - Implement actual API calls for individual traces and bulk searches  
3. **JSON File Storage** - Save fetched traces as structured JSON files with organized directory layout
4. **Error Handling & Retries** - Implement robust error recovery with exponential backoff and partial results
5. **Progress Integration** - Connect real API operations with existing progress indication system

## Out of Scope

- Data transformation or analysis features (Phase 2)
- Database storage implementation  
- Google Sheets export functionality
- Advanced caching or incremental sync
- Custom LangSmith API authentication methods beyond API key

## Expected Deliverable

1. Running `lse fetch --trace-id abc123` with valid API key retrieves and stores actual trace data
2. Running `lse fetch --project my-project --limit 10` successfully fetches multiple traces with progress indication
3. All existing CLI parameters work with real API data and maintain backward compatibility

# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Zenrows Error Categorization
> Created: 2025-09-04

## Overview

Enhance the zenrows-errors report command to provide detailed error categorization and breakdown while maintaining the existing total error count functionality. This will enable stakeholders to understand the types of errors occurring during web scraping operations and prioritize fixes based on error categories such as HTTP errors, timeouts, and server downtime.

## User Stories

### Error Analysis by Category

As a data analyst, I want to see zenrows errors broken down by category (404s, timeouts, server errors, etc.), so that I can identify the most common failure patterns and prioritize infrastructure improvements or scraping strategy adjustments.

The analyst runs the enhanced zenrows-errors report and receives a CSV with additional columns showing the breakdown of errors by type. This allows them to quickly identify if failures are primarily due to rate limiting (429s), missing content (404s), or infrastructure issues (timeouts, 5xx errors).

### Historical Error Pattern Tracking

As an operations engineer, I want to track error categories over time to identify trends and recurring issues, so that I can proactively address systematic problems in our scraping infrastructure before they impact business operations.

The engineer uses the categorized error reports across date ranges to identify patterns such as increasing timeout rates during specific time periods or recurring 404 errors for certain data sources, enabling proactive maintenance and optimization.

## Spec Scope

1. **Error Categorization System** - Implement logic to classify zenrows_scraper errors into categories (HTTP status codes, timeouts, connection errors, etc.)
2. **Enhanced CSV Output** - Add new columns to existing CSV format showing breakdown by error category while preserving existing total count
3. **Backward Compatibility** - Maintain existing command interface and CSV structure, only adding new columns
4. **Category Detection** - Parse error messages and HTTP responses to automatically classify error types
5. **Aggregation Logic** - Update aggregation logic to sum categories across projects and date ranges

## Out of Scope

- Real-time error monitoring or alerting capabilities
- Modification of existing trace data storage format
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Error resolution or retry mechanisms
- Custom error category definitions (use standard HTTP/network error classifications)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced zenrows-errors command that outputs CSV with additional error category columns while maintaining existing total error count
2. Automatic error classification for common error types (4xx, 5xx HTTP codes, timeouts, connection failures)
3. Preserved functionality for both single-date and date-range reporting with project filtering

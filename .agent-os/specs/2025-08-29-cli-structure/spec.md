# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: CLI Application Structure
> Created: 2025-08-29

## Overview

Implement a Typer-based command-line interface structure for the LangSmith Extractor tool, providing a clean and intuitive way for users to fetch trace data from LangSmith. This foundation will support all future CLI commands and establish patterns for configuration management and error handling.

## User Stories

### Basic CLI Usage

As a Hivekind data analyst, I want to use simple CLI commands to fetch LangSmith traces, so that I can automate data extraction without using the web UI.

The user opens their terminal and types `lse fetch` followed by appropriate parameters. The tool validates their configuration, connects to the LangSmith API, fetches the requested traces, and saves them locally with clear progress indication. If any errors occur, they receive helpful error messages explaining what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Configuration Management

As an engineering team member, I want to configure API credentials once and have them securely stored, so that I don't need to provide them with every command.

The user creates a `.env` file in the project root with their LangSmith API key and other settings. When they run any `lse` command, the tool automatically loads these settings. They can override specific settings via command-line arguments when needed for one-off operations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Typer CLI Application** - Set up main application entry point with Typer framework and command structure
2. **Fetch Command Scaffold** - Create basic `fetch` command with placeholder functionality and parameter definitions
3. **Configuration Loading** - Implement `.env` file loading using python-dotenv with validation
4. **Progress Indication** - Add progress bars using rich or tqdm for long-running operations
5. **Error Handling Framework** - Establish consistent error handling patterns with helpful user messages

## Out of Scope

- Actual LangSmith API integration (separate spec)
- Data storage implementation (separate spec)
- Authentication logic beyond loading credentials
- Multiple command implementations beyond `fetch`
- Colored terminal output
- JSON output formatting

## Expected Deliverable

1. Running `lse --help` displays help information about available commands
2. Running `lse fetch --help` shows fetch command options and parameters
3. Configuration successfully loads from `.env` file when present
